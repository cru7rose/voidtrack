**Technical Specification: DTO Definitions and JSON and XML Schemas for Enterprise Systems**

**I. Introduction**

[cite_start]This document constitutes a comprehensive technical specification for the project, focusing on the definitions of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), JSON schemas, and XML schemas (XSD)[cite: 7]. [cite_start]The goal is to establish clear, consistent, and market-best-practice-compliant standards for data exchange in enterprise-class systems[cite: 8]. [cite_start]This specification is intended for system architects, developers, and integration teams to ensure a uniform approach to designing and implementing interfaces and data structures[cite: 9]. [cite_start]The scope of the document includes detailed guidelines for designing DTOs, creating and validating JSON and XSD schemas, and integrating these elements with APIs, taking into account key security aspects[cite: 9]. [cite_start]All presented standards and conventions are based on recognized industry practices and aim to ensure the interoperability, scalability, and maintainability of the solutions being built[cite: 10].

**II. General Design Principles and Standards**

[cite_start]Effective specification management in corporate systems is the foundation for ensuring the quality, consistency, and efficiency of data exchange processes[cite: 11]. [cite_start]Key principles include the centralization of information, standardization, and ensuring that data is current and complete[cite: 12].

**A. Fundamental Principles of Specification Management in Corporate Systems**

Implementing robust specification management practices brings tangible benefits, such as error reduction, improved procurement processes, and ensuring traceability and compliance. [cite_start]A central element is establishing a common language for all specifications, which minimizes the risk of misunderstandings and inconsistencies[cite: 13]. [cite_start]When teams work in isolation or rely on outdated information, discrepancies, rework, and costly delays can result[cite: 14]. [cite_start]Centralized and easily accessible specifications reduce this risk by minimizing the chances of miscommunication[cite: 15].

Specification management is more than just collecting documents in a digital database. [cite_start]It is crucial to implement standardized formats, terminology, and naming conventions[cite: 16]. [cite_start]This ensures consistent interpretation of specifications and enables integration with other software platforms[cite: 16]. [cite_start]Maintaining an appropriate level of standardization requires continuous attention, and specification management software can help identify defects and weaknesses that undermine the database's integrity[cite: 17].

[cite_start]It is also essential to ensure a complete set of data for each part, project, or process[cite: 18]. [cite_start]For example, a set of construction drawings may include elevation, section, or detail drawings that supplement general structural drawings and floor plans[cite: 18]. [cite_start]Related specifications must remain organized and synchronized in the event of changes or modifications to the document lifecycle[cite: 19]. [cite_start]Verifying the completeness of information requires a combination of effective software tools and robust specification management practices[cite: 20]. [cite_start]The availability of accurate and up-to-date specifications distinguishes the best specification management processes from outdated, paper-based methods[cite: 20]. [cite_start]Real-time updates and version control processes help segregate obsolete content while keeping it accessible for audit or historical purposes[cite: 21].

**B. Approach to the Canonical Data Model (CDM)**

[cite_start]A Canonical Data Model (CDM) is a data model that contains a standard and common set of definitions, including data types, data structures, relationships, and rulesâ€”all independent of any specific application[cite: 22]. [cite_start]The introduction of a CDM is a response to the complexity of integration in modern application architectures, which often consist of multiple subsystems and applications using different technology stacks or programming languages, such as microservices or service-oriented architectures (SOA)[cite: 22]. [cite_start]Each of these architectures may have a different data format, which complicates data exchange, data management, and interoperability[cite: 22]. [cite_start]A CDM enables all integrations to share a common understanding of the data passed between them, minimizing dependencies and improving data consistency and management[cite: 23].

The benefits of using a CDM are significant. [cite_start]Primarily, it reduces the number of data translations between multiple systems[cite: 24]. [cite_start]In a scenario without a CDM, as the number of connected systems increases, the number of necessary translations grows exponentially[cite: 25]. [cite_start]A CDM simplifies this process by requiring each system to only transform to and from the canonical format[cite: 26]. [cite_start]Furthermore, a CDM provides a standard data model for different systems, regardless of their own models, leading to consistent formats, definitions, and data structures, and consequently, higher data quality and better business decisions[cite: 26]. [cite_start]A Canonical Data Model can be defined in an agreed-upon format, such as Plain Old XML (POX), formats used in SOA, or JSON[cite: 26].

[cite_start]In the context of this project, the CDM will serve as a central point of reference for data structures exchanged between key system components[cite: 26]. [cite_start]The following matrix presents the planned use of data formats and their mapping to the CDM[cite: 27].

**Table 1: Data Format Usage Matrix**
| System/Interface | Primary Data Format | Schema Type (JSON Schema/XSD) | Rationale for Choice | Mapping to CDM (if applicable) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| External API (REST) | JSON | JSON Schema | [cite_start]Lightweight, widespread support in web technologies, fast parsing. [cite: 27] | [cite_start]Mapping DTO fields to their CDM equivalents. [cite: 27] |
| Inter-service Communication (gRPC) | Protobuf | .proto files | [cite_start]High performance, compact binary format, strong typing, schema evolution. [cite: 27] | [cite_start]Mapping Protobuf fields to their CDM equivalents. [cite: 27] |
| Integration with Legacy Systems (SOAP) | XML | XSD | [cite_start]Requirements of legacy systems, need for rigorous validation and complex hierarchical structures. [cite: 27] | [cite_start]Mapping XSD elements to their CDM equivalents. [cite: 27] |
| Batch File Exchange | XML or JSON | XSD or JSON Schema | Dependent on partner requirements; [cite_start]XML for complex structures, JSON for simpler transfers. [cite: 28] | [cite_start]Mapping file structures to their CDM equivalents. [cite: 28] |
| Event Communication (e.g., Kafka) | Avro or JSON | Avro Schema or JSON Schema | Avro for performance and schema evolution in streaming systems; [cite_start]JSON for simpler events. [cite: 29] | [cite_start]Mapping event fields to their CDM equivalents. [cite: 29] |

[cite_start]The use of a CDM combined with clearly defined JSON and XSD schemas for individual interfaces will ensure consistency and facilitate data management throughout the project's ecosystem[cite: 30].

### Technical Clarifications

Here are the detailed answers to your specific technical questions, synthesized from all the provided documents.

#### **1. Technology Versions**

The documents do not specify exact version numbers for most technologies (e.g., "Java 17" or "Spring Boot 3.1"). However, they provide strong indicators of the intended technological era, pointing towards modern, stable, and well-supported versions:

* [cite_start]**Java:** The recommendation to use `records` for immutable DTOs implies a modern Java version[cite: 48]. [cite_start]Java Records were introduced as a standard feature in **Java 16**[cite: 49]. This indicates the project should use Java 16 or newer (e.g., LTS versions like Java 17 or 21).
* [cite_start]**JSON Schema:** The specification explicitly states the use of `$schema: "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"` in its examples[cite: 87]. This specifies that **Draft 07** of the JSON Schema specification should be used for defining and validating JSON structures.
* **XML/XSD:** The standard referred to is `xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"`, which is **XSD 1.0**. While XSD 1.1 exists, 1.0 remains the most widely adopted standard.
* **Frameworks (Spring, etc.):** While not versioned, the adoption of a microservices architecture, API gateways, and standards like OAuth2 and JWT suggests the use of current, mature frameworks like recent versions of Spring Boot, which have robust support for these patterns.
* [cite_start]**Databases:** Specific versions are not mentioned, but the recommendation to use technologies like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis implies using recent, stable releases of these systems[cite: 372].

**Conclusion:** The project is designed around modern but established technologies. [cite_start]The team should select the latest long-term support (LTS) or stable versions of the chosen technologies at the start of Faza 0 (Analysis and Design)[cite: 448].

#### **2. Sync/Async Communication**

The architecture clearly defines distinct patterns for synchronous and asynchronous communication based on the use case.

* **Synchronous (Sync) Communication:**
    * **Primary Technology:** REST APIs over HTTP(S).
    * **Use Cases:**
        1.  [cite_start]**External Integration:** All communication with external systems, such as an ERP/WMS or client platforms, is explicitly defined as synchronous via REST API[cite: 4, 221].
        2.  **Client-to-Backend:** The web frontend (Vue.js) and the mobile application (Flutter) interact with the backend via the OMS API Gateway using REST APIs.
        3.  **Internal Communication:** REST is also mentioned as an option for inter-service communication between microservices, particularly for request-response interactions.

* **Asynchronous (Async) Communication:**
    * **Primary Technology:** Apache Kafka.
    * **Use Cases:**
        1.  [cite_start]**Internal Events:** Kafka is explicitly designated for **internal communication between microservices only**[cite: 4, 27]. It functions as an event bus for propagating state changes and events throughout the system.
        2.  **Decoupling Services:** This pattern is ideal for scenarios where an action in one service needs to trigger non-blocking actions in other services. For example, when an `Order Service` changes an order's status, it can publish an `OrderUpdated` event to a Kafka topic. The `Audit Service`, `Notification Service`, and `Analytics Service` can then consume this event independently and asynchronously.
    * [cite_start]**Schema Management:** For Kafka, the use of a Schema Registry (like Confluent or Apicurio) with Avro or JSON Schema is recommended to ensure data consistency and manage schema evolution between producers and consumers[cite: 29, 81, 83].

#### **3. Scalability**

The architecture is explicitly designed for scalability using modern, cloud-native principles.

* **Architectural Approach:**
    * [cite_start]**Microservices:** The system is broken down into small, independent services (Order, Route, Fleet, etc.)[cite: 359]. [cite_start]This allows for **horizontal scaling**, where individual services can be scaled independently based on their specific load[cite: 368]. For example, if route planning is computationally intensive, more instances of the `Route Service` can be deployed without affecting other services.
    * [cite_start]**Cloud-Native:** The architecture is designed to be deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP[cite: 222, 368]. [cite_start]This provides access to elastic resources, allowing the system to dynamically scale up or down in response to demand[cite: 306].

* **Key Technologies and Patterns:**
    * [cite_start]**Containerization and Orchestration:** The use of Docker for containerizing services and Kubernetes for orchestrating them is recommended[cite: 363]. Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
    * [cite_start]**Load Balancing:** Load balancers are a key component, distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances of a service to prevent any single instance from becoming a bottleneck[cite: 369].
    * **Asynchronous Decoupling:** Using Kafka as an event bus helps to handle load spikes by decoupling services. A producing service can publish messages to Kafka at a high rate, and consuming services can process them at their own pace, preventing system overload.
    * [cite_start]**Database Scalability:** The architecture allows for using different types of databases (Polyglot Persistence) based on the needs of each microservice (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, Time-series)[cite: 372]. This allows for choosing the most scalable database technology for each specific task.

#### **4. Consistency**

The project places a very high emphasis on ensuring data consistency across a distributed system through several layers of governance and technical standards.

* **Data Model Consistency:**
    * [cite_start]**Canonical Data Model (CDM):** The cornerstone of the consistency strategy is the establishment of a CDM[cite: 22]. [cite_start]The CDM acts as the single, authoritative "language" for data within the ecosystem, ensuring that all services have a shared understanding of core business entities (like an Order, Customer, or Address)[cite: 23]. [cite_start]Every service maps its internal data structures to this canonical model when communicating[cite: 26].

* **Contract and Interface Consistency:**
    * [cite_start]**Standardized DTOs:** Strict rules are defined for creating Data Transfer Objects, including naming conventions (`RequestDto`, `ResponseDto`), specific granularity (separate DTOs for lists vs. details), and immutability[cite: 34, 38, 48]. This ensures that data contracts between services are predictable and clear.
    * **Schema-Driven Development:** All data exchange is governed by formal, machine-readable schemas. [cite_start]JSON Schema is used for REST APIs, and XSD is used for XML/SOAP integrations[cite: 66, 91]. [cite_start]These schemas define the exact structure, types, and constraints of the data, and are used for validation at API boundaries[cite: 138].

* **Lifecycle and Versioning Consistency:**
    * [cite_start]**Schema Registry:** The use of a Schema Registry is recommended, especially for asynchronous communication via Kafka[cite: 81]. [cite_start]The registry acts as a single source of truth for all schemas, enforces compatibility rules (e.g., backward compatibility), and prevents breaking changes from being deployed accidentally[cite: 82, 84].
    * [cite_start]**Centralized Specification Management:** All artifactsâ€”DTO code, schemas, and API definitionsâ€”are to be stored in a version control system (like Git) and managed centrally[cite: 193]. This creates an auditable history and ensures all teams are working from the same definitions.

#### **5. Endpoint Exposure**

Endpoint exposure is managed through a controlled, secure, and centralized approach using an API Gateway.

* [cite_start]**API Gateway Pattern:** The architecture diagram clearly shows an **OMS API Gateway** as the single entry point for all external clients[cite: 273]. This includes the Web Frontend, the Mobile App, and any integrated ERP/WMS systems.
* **Decoupling:** The gateway decouples external clients from the internal microservice architecture. Clients only need to know the address of the gateway, not the individual addresses of the dozens of potential microservices. The gateway is responsible for routing incoming requests to the appropriate internal service (e.g., a request to `/api/orders` is routed to the `Order Service`).
* **Security Enforcement:** The API Gateway is a critical security checkpoint.
    * **Authentication & Authorization:** It is the layer responsible for enforcing security policies. [cite_start]All requests must be authenticated, for example, using **OAuth2 and JWTs**[cite: 6, 151]. The gateway validates the token before forwarding the request to an internal service.
    * [cite_start]**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access to specific endpoints is controlled by user roles (e.g., `admin`, `dispatcher`, `driver`)[cite: 6]. The gateway, in conjunction with a User/Auth service, ensures that a user with a `driver` role cannot access an endpoint intended for an `admin`.
* **Other Gateway Functions:** The gateway can also handle other cross-cutting concerns like rate limiting, logging, request/response transformation, and caching, further simplifying the internal microservices.

#### **6. Auditability**

Auditability is a first-class concern in the system, addressed by a dedicated service and clear data structures.

* [cite_start]**Dedicated Audit Service:** The architecture explicitly includes an **Audit Service** as a core microservice[cite: 5]. Its sole responsibility is to record and provide access to a comprehensive audit trail.
* [cite_start]**Comprehensive Logging:** The system is designed to log every significant action and data modification[cite: 5]. This includes:
    * Order lifecycle changes (e.g., `NEW` -> `PICKUP` -> `POD`).
    * Edits to any core entity (e.g., changing an address on an order).
    * Creation of new entities (e.g., a new order, a new user).
    * Security-relevant events.
    * ePoD (Electronic Proof of Delivery) submissions.
* [cite_start]**Standardized Audit Data (`AuditDto`):** A specific DTO, the `AuditDto`, is defined to ensure that all audit logs are structured and consistent[cite: 5]. It captures:
    * `entityType`: Which kind of object was changed (e.g., Order, User).
    * `entityId`: The specific ID of the object.
    * `action`: What happened (e.g., `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `STATUS_CHANGE`).
    * `userId`: Who performed the action.
    * `timestamp`: When the action occurred.
    * `details`: A JSON object containing the specifics of the change (e.g., old vs. new values).
* [cite_start]**Access to Audit History:** The system will provide dedicated endpoints for authorized users (like `admin` or `superuser`) to query and review the audit history[cite: 5]. This is crucial for accountability, debugging, and compliance purposes.
* **Specification Auditability:** Beyond runtime actions, the specifications themselves are auditable. [cite_start]By storing schemas and API definitions in version control and using a Schema Registry, there is a full, traceable history of how the system's data contracts have evolved over time[cite: 32, 193].
